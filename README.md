# DotNetCoreDemoWebApiApplication

You are asked to create a JavaScript web application and C# REST API back end. 
The JavaScript client is to have a responsive UI and display appropriately on desktop and mobile device browsers.

The application is to display a list of book titles when launched. The book list is to be loaded from a database. 
No other book operations (delete, update, etc.) or book data (e.g. price) are necessary. 
The user can select a book, add it to a shopping cart, list the items in the cart, remove a book from the cart, 
and check out. Use REST API for both the book and cart API (including the check-out action). 
Checking out will clear the cart. Logging in and out is not necessary. 
If the user exited the app but didn't clear their cart by checking out, the cart needs to be loaded when the application is restarted.

The solution should be created using the .NET 5 framework in the C# language. Ideally it uses React for the front end, but if that proves challenging then use a front-end framework of your choice.

BONUS 1: Create tests for the front and back end.

BONUS 2: Include prices in the book lists. Show the book prices in the cart and display total with tax.


Notes on this project:
This application demonstrates the .Net Core 5 Web API, a separate React front end project will be created soon!

Features:

Implementing Entity Framework Core in ASP.NET Core WebApi â€“ Code-First Approach

DB Initializer for seeding data

Using SQLite DB (locally created by initializer)

Trying out Model abstraction and table per model approach


TODO:

Add interfaces for the actions

Add DTO's so we can also persist: created date, modified date, is deleted, etc.

Unit tests
